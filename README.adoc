== Prerequisites

* Ruby 3.x (best to use rvm).
* Bundler (usually included now).
* Graphviz

== Setup

`bundle install`

== Run

`bundle exec jekyll serve -l --future --livereload-ignore assets/images/generated/*`

This will:

* Run Jekyll and serve website.
* Live reload.
* Show future-dated content.
* Ignore generated assets to avoid continually rebuilding (some kind of glitch).
