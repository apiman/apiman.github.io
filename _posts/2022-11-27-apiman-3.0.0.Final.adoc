= Apiman 3, a leap forward
:discussion: https://github.com/orgs/apiman/discussions
:allow-uri-read: true

I'm delighted to announce that I have released Apiman 3.

This is one of the most significant releases in Apiman's history, with a considerable number of new features and behind-the-scenes improvements.

Oh, and I've created a completely new Jekyll-based website for Apiman that will help me better automate releases â€” I hope you like it!

There is also a new Docker Compose distribution that makes Apiman easier than ever to try out; https://www.apiman.com/download.html[please give it a go^] and {discussion}[let us know your thoughts^].

Feedback and community interaction is critical to the future of the project, so please give us a bit of your time in return for the huge effort that has gone into Apiman 3 ðŸ™Œ.

== What's new?

I'm glad that you asked.
What's not new!

As of Apiman 3, we are now maintaining a comprehensive changelog to ensure that it's absolutely clear what we've added in a new release.
You can see this on https://www.github.com/apiman/apiman/tree/master/CHANGELOG.adoc[our official changelog on GitHub^].
It's also a good way to see the latest features and changes that we're working on as development is in progress.
