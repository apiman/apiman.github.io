I'm delighted to announce that I have released Apiman 3.0.0.Final.

This is one of the most significant releases in Apiman's history, with a considerable number of new features and behind-the-scenes improvements.

There is also a new Docker Compose distribution that makes Apiman easier than ever to try out; https://www.apiman.com/download.html[please give it a go^] and {discussion}[let us know your thoughts^].

Oh, and I've created a completely new Jekyll-based website for Apiman that will help me better automate releases — I hope you like it!

Feedback and community interaction is critical to the future of the project, so [please give us a bit of your time^] in return for the huge effort that has gone into Apiman 3 🙌.
