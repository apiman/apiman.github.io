= Apiman 3.1.0 released!
:allow-uri-read: true

I'm delighted to announce that I have released Apiman 3.1.0.Final.

Aside from numerous bug fixes and a few interesting new features, this includes a security fix for link:/blog/potential-permissions-bypass-disclosure/[CVE-2023-28640^].


Due to an issue with the release pipeline, we ended up having to cut a 3.1.1.Final release also, but it's identical to 3.0.0.Final.
