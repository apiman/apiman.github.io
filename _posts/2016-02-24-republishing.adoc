= Re-Publishing Your API(s)

An early design decision we made in apiman was to not allow APIs to be
re-published to the Gateway.  The reasoning was that Client Apps may have
established Contracts with the API, and thus have agreed to specific terms
and conditions (whether implicit or explicit).  Therefore, we shouldn't
allow the API provider to modify those terms and re-publish the API, as it
may violate the agreement.

However, we later added the concept of a Public API, which allows any
client to invoke it without first creating a Contract.  It is clear that
API providers should be able to re-publish a Public API (presumably after
changing the API's configuration).

[#when-can-i-re-publish]
== When Can I Re-Publish?

An API can be re-published to the Gateway when the following criteria is
met:

* It is a Public API
* The API is in the _Published_ state
* The API has been modified in some way

Additionally, if the Public API has been retired (is currently in the
_Retired_ state) then the user can Re-Publish it regardless of whether
it has since been modified.

[#how-do-i-re-publish]
== How Do I Re-Publish?

When an API meets the above criteria, a *Re-Publish* button will be
available in the user interface (right where the "Publish" button is
typically located).

As soon as you're comfortable with the changes you've made to your API,
simply click the button, and you should be all set!

[#why-is-there-still-versioning]
== Why Is There Still Versioning?

This feature does not take the place of API versioning.  Versioning
is still very important because you may want to publish multiple
versions of the same API at the same time (for example, if you
actually need to support multiple versions of a live API).  In
addition, if an API is not public, then you will still need to
use versioning if you want to change the policy configuration for
your API.

[#conclusion]
== Conclusion

As always, a goal of apiman is to make the system as easy to use as
possible, while still being useful and powerful.  We think that this
approach is a reasonable compromise.  You still can't re-publish an
API if there are established Contracts with Client Apps, but if you're
only using Public APIs, then there's no reason to prevent changes from
being republished!
