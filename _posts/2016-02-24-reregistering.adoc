= Re-Registering Your Client App(s)

In a recent blog post I explained why APIs used to be completely frozen
once they were published, and how we have loosened that restriction for
Public APIs.  Similarly, we did not allow Client Apps to be changed and
then re-registered.  This was never a good decision, since the Client App
does not have anything "connected" to it (the way that an API may).  So
we should never have restricted the registration of a Client App!

== When Can I Re-Register?

A Client App can be re-registered to the Gateway whenever it has been
modified, or if it has been un-registered (is in the _Retired_ state).

[#how-do-i-re-register]
== How Do I Re-Register?

When you have made some changes to your Client App, you can re-register
it by clicking the *Re-Register* button in the UI.

As soon as you're comfortable with the changes you've made to your
Client App, simply click the button, and you should be all set!

[#conclusion]
== Conclusion

Again, we should never have restricted when users can update the settings
of a Client App in the gateway.  This change should make it much easier
for Client App Developers to make sensible changes and then push those
changes to the gateway!
