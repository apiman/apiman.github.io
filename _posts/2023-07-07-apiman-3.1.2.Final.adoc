= Apiman 3.1.2 released!
:allow-uri-read: true

I'm delighted to announce that I have released Apiman 3.1.2.Final.

One particularly useful change I'd like to highlight is that the Vert.x Gateway's API, when secured by Keycloak, now accepts a list of additionally accepted issuers using `allowed-ussers`, which is useful for users with more complex auth setups:

[source,json5]
----
{
  // <rest of your config...>

  // Gateway API Authentication. See documentation for further possibilities.
  "auth": {
    "type": "keycloak",
    "config": {
      "flowType": "PASSWORD",
      "requiredRole": "realm:apipublisher",
      "auth-server-url": "...",
      // You can add extra issuers here.
      "allowed-issuers": [ // <1>
        "http://keycloak:8080",
        "https://auth.example.com"
      ],
      "realm": "${apiman.auth.realm:-apiman}",
      "resource": "apiman-gateway-api",
      "credentials": {
        "secret": "${apiman.auth.gateway.secret:-password}"
      },
      "ssl-required": "none",
      "disable-trust-manager": true,
      "allow-any-hostname" : true
    }
  }
}
----
<1> You can add extra issuers here; this can be very useful if your setup has internal vs external issuers, and you need to support them all simultaneously.
