    </p>
    <p>
      Black Parrot Labs provides long-term, enterprise-grade support and professional services 
      to companies using Apiman in production. 
      We ensure that our clients have the confidence to deploy critical Apiman workloads, 
      knowing they have our unparalleled Apiman expertise behind them if something goes wrong.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      We have successfully undertaken a range of projects for our clients, from integration of 
      Apiman into existing platforms to provide API Management capabilities, to expert support
      for complex issues.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      One of our <strong>core missions is to ensure the health of the Apiman open source community</strong>; 
      we invest a large proportion of our engineering and financial resources into maintaining Apiman. 
      No other company has this commitment, and we have been the principal contributors 
      and maintainers of the Apiman project for a long time.

      Nobody knows Apiman better.

      Apiman was started by a small team of engineers at Red Hat's middleware division (then called JBoss).
      After an acquisition, Red Hat decided they would not continue actively sponsoring the project. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Without Red Hat, Apiman would not exist! 
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense thank you to those who enabled Apiman to thrive ðŸ™Œ.
