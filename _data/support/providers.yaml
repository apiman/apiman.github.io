      Black Parrot Labs was founded by Apiman's co-founder and current maintainer 
      <a href="https://www.github.com/msavy" target="_blank">Marc Savy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Parrot Labs provides long-term, enterprise-grade support to companies using Apiman 
      in production. 
      We ensure that our clients have the confidence to deploy critical Apiman workloads, 
      knowing they have people that created Apiman behind them if something goes wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of our <strong>core missions is to ensure the health of the Apiman open source community</strong>; 
      we invest a large proportion of our engineering and financial resources into maintaining Apiman. 
      No other company has this commitment, and we have been the principal contributors 
      and maintainers of the Apiman project for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Parrot Labs even contributed the Apiman website!

      Apiman was started by a small team of engineers at Red Hat's middleware division (then called JBoss).
      After an acquisition, Red Hat decided they would not continue actively sponsoring in the project. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Without Red Hat, Apiman would not exist! 
      An immense thank you to those who enabled Apiman to thrive ðŸ™Œ.
