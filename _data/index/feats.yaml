  description: |
    <ul class="ps-3">
      <li class="pb-2"><strong>Throttling & Quotas</strong>: Limit the number of requests consumers of your APIs can make within a given time period (per API contract or per end-user).</li>
      <li class="pb-2"><strong>Centralised Security</strong>: Add authentication and IP filtering capabilities in a central location, freeing your back-end APIs to focus on functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing & Metrics</strong>: Easily get metrics for all your APIs so you can see what's popular or charge your consumers for their usage.</li>
    </ul>

- title: Run Anywhere, At Scale

    <p>There are no limitations on where you can run Apiman.</p> 
    <p>Whether you need to run on airgapped bare metal or in the cloud, Apiman users have 
    successfully deployed systems running critical API Management workloads.</p>
    <p>Apiman Gateways are decoupled from the Apiman Manager, so even if a manager goes down, your gateways continue running.</p>
