:apiman-version: {{ site.data.releases.stable.version }}
:ghcr: https://github.com/orgs/apiman/packages
:keycloak-guide: https://www.apiman.io/apiman-docs/installation-guide/{apiman-version}/keycloak.html

Previously, we published our images to DockerHub only.
As of Apiman 3, our canonical repository is the {ghcr}[Apiman GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)^], but we will continue publishing to DockerHub for now.

=== Prerequisites

* OCI-compatible container runtime (such as Docker, containerd, CRI-O, etc).
* You will need Keycloak running.
** Apiman must be {keycloak-guide}[configured to point at Keycloak^].

=== Images

* List of images and container-specific documentation on https://github.com/apiman/apiman/tree/{apiman-version}/containers#apiman-docker-images[Apiman Docker @ GitHub^].
* https://github.com/apiman/apiman-docker/blob/{apiman-version}/README.adoc[Official Apiman container repository (GHCR)^].

=== Configuration

* Typically, you will want to map at least port 8080 (HTTP) and 8443 (HTTPS).

Please refer to the Apiman Docs.
