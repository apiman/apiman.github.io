:apiman-version: {{ site.data.releases.stable.version }}
:ghcr: https://github.com/orgs/apiman/packages

Previously we published our images to DockerHub only.
As of Apiman 3, {ghcr}[our canonical repository^] is GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), but we will continue publishing to DockerHub for now.
