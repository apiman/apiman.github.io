Wow, this is a hidden page that [Marc](https://www.github.com/msavy) left here when he was creating the new Apiman website! 

Well done for finding it 😎. Here is your prize 🏆!

Apiman was founded while [Eric Wittmann](https://github.com/EricWittmann) and [Marc Savy](https://www.github.com/msavy) worked at Red Hat. Later we were joined by [Rachel Yordán](https://github.com/kahboom) and eventually our wonderful QE team (Len DiMaggio, Jakub Čecháček, Miroslav Jaros, and Štefan Bunčiak) .

After Red Hat did an acquisition, Eric and Rachel moved onto [other things](https://www.github.com/apicurio) internally, and Marc left Red Hat.

Marc has continued working (way too hard) on Apiman, and founded [Black Parrot Labs](https://www.blackparrotlabs.io) as a way to fund continued development and provide support for enterprises using Apiman.   

I should probably create and link a proper 'about' page at some point soon :-).
