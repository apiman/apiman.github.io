<p>It&#8217;s been almost two months since Red Hat announced it was acquiring 3scale Technologies and turning
the 3scale API Management solution into a Red Hat supported product. In that time, we&#8217;ve been trying
to figure out some stuff for the apiman community. Here some of the things we wanted to suss out:
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How the apiman development team can best focus its efforts, now that 3scale will be the basis for Red Hat&#8217;s API Management technology.
<li>
<p>How to best support the existing apiman community going forward, given the restrictions on continued development of the apiman API Management solution.
<li>
<p>How can existing apiman users transition to a Red Hat supported API Management solution.
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but it actually really is. We&#8217;ve made some preliminary decisions, and
because we want to be as transparent and upfront as possible, read on to find out what they are!
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know everyone in the apiman community probably has a lot of questions, so let&#8217;s dive right in (with
the most important questions first). Please note that none of this is written in stone - software
development in general, and this situation in particular, is often very fluid. I&#8217;m saying we reserve
the right to change our minds! But this post represents the best information we have right now - and
we like to keep the apiman community in the loop as much as possible.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, if you have questions that aren&#8217;t covered by this post (very likely!) you can always find
us on IRC or send questions to the mailing list. Links to both can be found up above in the "Get
Involved" menu.

<h2 id="what-will-happen-to-the-current-apiman-api-management-solution"><a class="anchor" href="#what-will-happen-to-the-current-apiman-api-management-solution"></a>What will happen to the current apiman API Management solution?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We discussed a number of options, but we think it&#8217;s best for everyone if we put the full apiman API
Management solution into maintenance mode. What does this mean? Well, it means that we will address
critical bugs and any issues that are trivial to implement/fix. Of course, we will continue to accept
community contributions, making sure that they meaningfully improve the overall solution. This will
allow anyone using a current version of apiman to continue using it, without worrying about the
community edition disappearing. However, it DOES mean that you should not expect significant new
features to be added (unless they are contributed by the larger apiman community).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be noted that apiman continues to be extremely extensible - so there&#8217;s nothing stopping
individual users from implementing their own core apiman components and/or custom policies. While
we would prefer it if custom components and policies developed by users were contributed back to
the project, we understand that it&#8217;s often either not appropriate or not possible.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We explored the idea of donating the apiman project to a popular open source software foundation
(e.g. apache or eclipse) but decided that it was premature. The idea hasn&#8217;t been ruled out for
the future, but for now we&#8217;re going to keep apiman right where it is.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obviously not all of our users were specifically looking for a Red Hat supported version. It&#8217;s
certainly the case that many are perfectly happy using the community edition. That said, many of
you may be wondering what the migration path will be from the apiman community edition to Red Hat&#8217;s
API Management solution.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are actually several aspects to this problem, and we won&#8217;t be able to solve them all. Ultimately
the answer is that there won&#8217;t be any sort of automatic migration from an apiman configuration to a 3scale
one.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>However</em>, we will be updating apiman&#8217;s API Gateway to work with the 3scale solution (acting as an optional
replacement for e.g. the 3scale NGINX-based gateway) while also supporting all existing apiman policies.<br>
Effectively, this will result in an API Gateway that will implement the 3scale gateway functionality <em>and</em>
the apiman gateway functionality (including custom policies!) in one neat package. For those of you in
the community who have invested time and effort into creating your own custom policies, this will allow
you to continue using them! Not only that, but you will continue to have access to all of the policies
that exist today in apiman (along with any new ones we might release in the future).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, we will be releasing a standalone community version of this new API Gateway - a version that
can be configured and can operate without any additional components (3scale or otherwise). At the same
time, we will have a version that works in conjunction with the current 3scale platform (again, as an
alternative to the 3scale NGINX- based gateway).

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other than creating and maintaining the already mentioned Java-based API Gateway, the apiman team will not
be contributing significantly to the 3scale API Management product/platform at this time. There are a
number of reasons for this, but the primary issue is that apiman and 3scale have chosen very different
languages and technologies as the basis for our respective solutions. We don&#8217;t have any experience/expertise
in the technologies that make up the 3scale platform, and vice versa.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, 3scale already has a superb team of engineers, testers, and designers. I&#8217;m quite certain that
the future of Red Hat&#8217;s API Management technology is very bright!

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well we&#8217;ve already mentioned the new (repurposed?) API Gateway that will go a long way to bring together the
3scale and apiman technologies. In addition to that, we have a few new things in the pipeline.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One additional API Management related mini-project that we&#8217;ve already put together is a standalone Rate
Limiting [Micro-]Service. The goal of "apiman-rls" is to create a specially designed server that can manage
large numbers of rate limits in an efficient and accurate way. A new github repository has already been
created and we&#8217;ve already got a prototype implementation, which you can find here:

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, we&#8217;re exploring a number of other new projects, although it&#8217;s too early to talk about them
yet (no final decisions have been made). Keep your eye on this space for future announcements!

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As always, thanks for reading this blog post. And of course, thank you to the entire apiman community
for your interest, support AND for being awesome! Of course we would have preferred to see the apiman
project continue to be Red Hat&#8217;s commercial API Management solution. That wasn&#8217;t in the cards, but I
know that we and the newly acquired 3scale team will do their damndest to push out the best API Management
solution possible!
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, here are some takeaways from this post, just to reinforce them.
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apiman is staying right where it is, but will be put into "maintenance" mode - we&#8217;ll only be working on critical bugs and easy-to-implement issues.
<li>
<p>We&#8217;ll be releasing a new version of the API Gateway that works with the 3scale technology, but ALSO functions in a standalone community mode.
<li>
<p>All existing apiman policies will be ported to the new API Gateway.
<li>
<p>Custom apiman policies will be trivial to modify such that they work in the new API Gateway.
<li>
<p>New apiman branded project: Rate Limiting [Micro-]Service (apiman-rls)
