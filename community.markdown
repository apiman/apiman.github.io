title: Contribute to the Apiman Project
---

Apiman was founded while [Eric Wittmann](https://github.com/EricWittmann) and [Marc Savy](https://www.github.com/msavy) worked at Red Hat in Kevin Connor's team.  

Later we were joined by [Rachel Yordán](https://github.com/kahboom) and eventually our wonderful QE team (Len DiMaggio, Jakub Čecháček, Miroslav Jaros, and Štefan Bunčiak) .

After Red Hat did an acquisition, Eric and Rachel moved onto [other things](https://www.github.com/apicurio) internally, and Marc left Red Hat.

Marc has continued working (way too hard) on Apiman, and founded [Black Parrot Labs](https://www.blackparrotlabs.io) as a way to fund continued development of Apiman, and provide commercial-grade support for enterprises using Apiman.

As with so many open source projects, whilst the benefit of Apiman has been felt widely, the overwhelming bulk of contributions have been made by a small number of dedicated individuals.

Without Apiman's stalwarts over the years, there would be no Apiman, so we thank everyone who has contributed and keeps the project vibrant 🙌.
